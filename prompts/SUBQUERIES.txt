Objective:

Decompose the main query into a set of sub-queries that progressively refine and explore distinct aspects of the question. These sub-queries will be used to search a vector database as part of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The results from these searches, along with the original query, will then be processed by an LLM to generate the final answer.

Instructions:
	1.	Sub-Query Breakdown:
	    •	Analyze the main query and break it down into logically structured sub-queries.
	    •	Each sub-query should focus on a specific element, such as:
	        •	Foundational Concepts: Basic definitions or background information.
	        •	Key Components: Essential parts or features related to the query.
	        •	Step-by-Step Processes: Procedures or methods for addressing the query.
	2.	Logical Structure:
	    •	Organize the sub-queries in a sequence that builds from general understanding to more detailed analysis.
	    •	Ensure that the progression aids in forming a comprehensive answer when combined with the vector database results.
	3.	Limit on Sub-Queries:
	    •	Generate a maximum of 4 sub-queries. The exact number should reflect the complexity of the main query and the depth of exploration required.
	4.	Clarity and Precision:
	    •	Each sub-query must be clear, concise, and directly related to an aspect of the main query.
	    •	Avoid ambiguity and ensure that every sub-query can independently guide a targeted search.

Example:
	•	Main Query: How to build a RAG System?
	•	Sub-Queries:
	    1.	What is a RAG System?
	    2.	What are the key components of a RAG System?
	    3.	What are the step-by-step processes required to build a RAG System?

Context Reminder:
These sub-queries are integral for iteratively searching the vector database. Each sub-query, together with the original query, will help the LLM synthesize a final, well-rounded answer.
