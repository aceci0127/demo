GUIDELINES
    Analyze the entire conversation up to the user’s most recent message. 
    If this final request or question relies on information from previous exchanges, enrich it by clearly indicating the relevant context—but keep the user’s wording, punctuation, and format exactly as originally stated. 

EXAMPLE

    Sample Conversation Snippet
	    •	User (first message):
            “Hello, I’m looking for cheap ways to soundproof my home office.”
	    •	Assistant:
            “Here are four budget-friendly ideas: 1) Thick rugs, 2) Acoustic panels, 3) Sealing gaps in doors/windows, 4) Bookcases.”
	    •	User (second message):
            “Okay, thanks. Which of these ideas is the cheapest, and can you add approximate costs?”

        The regenerated query should be:
            “Which of the cheapest soundproof system for my home office, and can you add approximate costs?”
￼
GOAL: 
    Produce the final user query adding context details, writing it as a single standing question.
